For test next week - need to know:
----------------------------------
- Usually put test on 5th week, but it's only worth 25%
- Cutoff is first three classes -> nothing from today will be on next week's test
- Multiple choice ~ 35 questions
  - Majority from lecture material
  - Handfull (4-6) based on readings
  - Each question worth one point
  - "Half of the mistakes you make will ... be misreading the questions"
  - "I will never make you pick between a good answer and a better answer"
    - Every question will have one clear correct answer
    - "If A and B are right I'll give you an option for 'both A and B'"
- Tomorrow -> study guide on website
  - Won't replace lectures
  - Includes a list of reading sections (most 1-2 pages in length, 6-8 sections)
    - Partly:
      - Overlap with what was learned in class
      - Things that don't fit in regular lecture material
        - the first things that would be added if the course was longer
  - Listening list
    - Numbers correspond to numbers on song list on LEARN
    - Example questions:
      - publication date
      - form (like AABA)
      - what is unique/special about this piece
- Question time cutoff is 9pm Wednesday night
  - Any time before is guaranteed a response
  - Later -> may or may not get around to responding
- Test isn't in the lecture room

Where we left off:
------------------
- Radio world, post WW2
- Technology making african american culture more available
- Started as records made by and targeted towards a specific culture
- Many things moved to television, making space for new music on radios
- More young white teenages tuning in
  - Going to local record stores and buying what they heard on the radio
  - Causes albums to cross over from one music chard to another

1954: Cover versions
----------------------
- Caused by moral panic
  - When something is changing and some people feel threatened by it
  - Instead of adressing the root causes, target something on the surface
  - Ex: Toronto gang shootings
    - instead of figuring out why shooting took place, blamed it on hip-hop
    - Tried to block 50-cent from crossing the border
  - Became apparent to parents that children were taking part in black culture
    - Scare campaign due to racism:
      - Your kids grades will drop
      - They'll get involved in drugs
    - At that time concerts will be segregated:
      - What if they stop seggregating?
  - Solution: cover versions
- After a song climbs charts, a second version would appear
  - Original:
    - Black performer
    - Mmall label
  - Cover:
    - White performer
    - Major label
  - Would be on the charts at the same time
  - Happened more often in the south -> more exposure to black/country culture
  - Ex: Little Richard and "Tutti Frutti"
    - Born in Georgia
    - released "Tuttu Frutti" in 1955
    - "Crossover" hit #2 R&B and #17 Pop
    - Covered by Pat Boone:
      - born 1934
      - was just breaking as a pop star in 1955
      - soon after "Tutti Frutti" crosses over, his label tells him to cover "Tutti Frutti"
      - No R&B, #10 Pop
  - Covers rarely beat the original in original chart, but beat out the original in the pop chart
  - Ex: "Sh-Boom"
    - "not quite rock & roll", but still a combination of R&B, country, and pop
    - Original released by The Chords in 1954, with an independent record company
      - Black group
      - AABA only once, but with interludes inbetween
      - Hit on R&B and crosses over into Pop chart
      - Voice is distorted, use of much lower octave
      - Solo -> sexual metaphor
      - #3 R&B, #5 Pop
    - Covered by The Crew Cuts less than a month later, with Mercury, a major label
      - White group (also, Canadian - St. Mike's grads)
      - Fits a more standard AABA pattern and repeats it -> sounds more familiar
        - Writers knew what they were doing
      - Much safer sounding voices - clean sound, no lower octave
        - Again, very deliberately 
      - No solo
      - Timpani joke -> associated with cartoons
      - no R&B, #1 Pop for 9 weeks
      - #1 song of the year
- Same things happening to songs crossing over from country & western

Rock & Roll
-----------
- started in 1956
- term attributed to Alan Freed
  - term existed before, but he used it to describe this type of music
  - one of the first white disc jockeys in a position of power
  - had a radio show called "moondog's rock & roll houseparty"
    - routinely played black artists
    - Influential -> ex: Beetles used to be called Johnny & the Moondogs
- both black and white performers
- blended all three of the major chart worlds (pop, country, r&b)
- targeting teenagers
  - typically middle-class white teenagers

Bill Haley and the Comets
-------------------------
  - born in 1925
  - originally "Bill Haley and the Saddlemen"
  - western swing
  - changes name in 1952
  - early success with r&b covers (not like the covers before, these were older songs)
  - 1954 -> "Rock Around The Clock"
    - also a cover
    - becomes popular in 1955, but didn't do all that well immediately
      - Became popular due to film "Blackboard Jungle"
        - about school falling apart to gang violence until a teacher comes and sets them straight
        - a "moral panic" film
        - gangs destroy classical music records
        - theme song: "Rock Around The Clock"
        - becomes a symbol of rebellion ("my parents don't like it? coool")
      - peaks quickly -> Bill Haley quickly became too old
        - eclipsed by younger artists

Elvis Presley
-------------
- born in 1935 -> 18 years old in 1953
- Had a twin brother who died
- Poor, but mother found money so he never wanted for much
- Never writes a single song in his whole life
- By the time he was a teenager, listend to a lot of music
  - WDIA -> first black radio station
  - Liked r&b and country
  - Religious family so he knew a lot of church music
  - Looked up to a Tin Can Ally artist Dean Martin
- Auditioned for Sam Phillips, who ran Sun Records
  - Myth: around 1953, Sam Phillips, who was white (but had a connection to black music), had noticed a new sound emerging. One day he said something to his assistant, "if I could find a white man with the singing voice of a black man, I could make a million dollars"
    - Elivs walks in and thay said "thats the man"
    - Sam swore said he never said any of that and he wasn't impressed with Elivs at first
- Spring 1954 - records with Scotty Moore (Guitar) and Bill Black (Bass)
  - No drummer because Elivs is white
  - Record "That's Alright Momma"
    - Guitar and Bass are like western, but vocals are more blues
    - Sam immediately sent it to Dewey Moore, who owns a local radio station, "red, hot, and blue"
      - put on the recording which immediately becomes a hit
        - played up to 25 times in a row
      - next night Elvis was interviewed on the show
        - "Where did you go to High School, son?"
          - Why ask? To figure out if he's white or black, because schools are segregated
          - Most listeners thought they were listening to a black man
  - Released a record with "That's Alright Momma" as well as a new cover "Blue Moon of Kentucky"song
    - Original was a hit in 1948
    - Changed from a 3 (a country waltz) count to a 4 count
    - Sam Phillips: "That's a pop song now, little guy"
    - Bill Black now playing walking base, which comes from big band and r&b
    - Still no drummer, but Bill Black slapping the bass strings creates rhythmic precussion-like sounds
    - Half the lyrics are missing -> doesn't matter because the words don't matter, still gets the feeling across through the sound
      - "word sense to sound sense"
      - percussive quality to vocals -> black influence
    - Turned the song into "something new"
      - We know it as Rock & Roll
- Becomes one of the most famous people on earth by 1955
