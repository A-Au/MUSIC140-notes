Elvis - cont'd
--------------
- 1954 - 1955:
  - 12 songs -> all covers
    - All one one r&b/western and brings it inbetween the two, merging the styles
  - Elvis's style called Rockabilly
  - Elvis known as "The Hillbilly Cat"
    - Hillbilly -> self explanatory
    - Cat -> comes from black terminology
      - hip, leading edge of fashion
  - He's still a regional star, but some national success on Country Charts
- End of 1955:
  - Sam Phillips realizes elvis is on the verge of national stardom
  - Sells Elvis to RCA records to $35k
- Elvis's new manager -> Colonel Tom Parker
- Why sell elvis? (don't need to know this, it's just interesting)
  - Music typically industry works on a turnover of 90 days
  - Record companies produce all the records for the nation at once and send them out at the same time
    - Large upfront cost
    - Then send the money back to the artist/label, but only after 3 months
  - Sam knew he couldn't support that large upfront cost without going bankrupt while waiting for records to sell + get money back
- Largest contract for a pop musician at the time
  - Interesting fact: that $35k also funded Johnny Cash's first singles at Sun
- Elvis appears on national television 11 times in 1956
  - Context:
    - only 3 channels natinally
    - Viewership numbers are in the 10s of millions since there were so few options
  - Everyone with a television in NA knows who he is
  - Peak of his career
- "Heartbreak Hotel" -> April-May '56 -> #1 Pop/#1 Country/#5 R&B
  - First #1 on two charts at the same time
- August to December '56 -> "Hound Dog", "Don't Be Cruel", "Love me Tender"
  - all reach #1 Pop, and high on other two charts
  - Owns #1s all through this period
  - "Hound Dog" is the first song to hit #1 on all three charts
  - Scared the hell out of everyone
    - Covers kept black culture out of pop charts, and this breaks that strategy
  - Performs "Hound Dog" live and improvises a "sexual" (tame compared to today) dance
    - Outcry across the nation
      - Not directly about being on television or the dance
      - More about showing the audience (teenage girls) not being restrained
      - Threatens to "steal away their daughter's souls"
    - Bylaws attempted to be passed to ban him
  - Peak of his career
- Elvis no longer charting R&B after 1957
  - Reason: Colonel Tom Parker
    - Good promoter, but didn't see Elvis as changing the world
    - Just wanted him to get rich, so he influenced Elvis toward safer music
- Elvis enters the army in March 1958 - March 1960 -> Mandatory service
- March 1961 -> Last public performance for seven years
- Enters Hollywood by suggestion of Colonel Tom
  - Spends most of the rest of the 60s making "absolutely dreadful movies"
  - Made him rich, but Elvis missed his mid 50s life
- The 68' "Comeback Special" (fun fact: not actually the name of the show, but that's what people remember it by)
  - For 10 minutes with (mostly) the original band, wears a leather suit and plays
- 1970 - 1977: Las Vegas
  - Most tragic period of his life
  - Increasingly isolated, paranoid, and addicted to perscription drugs
  - Ended up surrounded by people who had a financial incentive to keep him going, rather than his best interest
- Dies August 16th, 1977
  - Found dead on the floor of his bathroom at 42 years old

Chuck Berry
-----------
- Arguably more influential than Elvis (or at least the prof thinks so)
  - Elvis only played acustic, and only even played part of the time
    - Guitar not a central aspect of what he did
  - Electric guitar was the central aspect for Chuck Berry
- Born in St. Louis
- A bit of an anomoly:
  - Influential musicicans of the time tended to be from the south 
  - Influential musicicans of the time usually came from a poor background
    - Chuck came from a middle clas background, his father was a contracter
- Only had one goal: To be rich
  - So much, he got involved with a group that tried to rob a bank, and ended up in jail
  - So how else for a black person? Either sports or music.
- Very self-conscious/deliberate in becoming sucessful (the most so in this course)
  - Knew from the start that he needed to stand out
  - Talent shows common in black cultures
    - He goes to many talent shows, but what does he do:
      - All other artist are standard R&B
      - Sings Country and Western, changing his sound to be more standard Country
      - Wins talent shows because he stood out
- Goes to Chess Records in Chicago on the advice of one of his heroes, Muddy Waters
- Carbon copy of what happened to Elvis earlier, but vice-versa
  - Get him to play R&B, not going well, agree to take a break
  - Plays around with a Country & Western song, "Ida Read" (pro. Ida Red), and they have the same response ("Omg that's the sound!")
  - Chess brothers say to Chuck:
    - "If you play that it'll be a hit, but you didn't write it so you won't make money"
    - Chuck changes lyrics to be a guy chasing a girl, but as a car chase
    - "Ida Red" becomes "Maybellene"
- Target's songs directly at his intended audience
  - Target market: teenagers -> specifically white, middle class teenagers
    - They want to re-invent themselves, to seperate themselves from their parents
    - For the first time: youth culture
    - At the heart of it all: freedom
  - Themes:
    - Cars (because it represents freedom)
    - Girls
    - No school
    - Rock n' Roll -> celebrating the music itself
- Few "cover versions" of Berry's songs -> why?
  - centrality of the electric guitar
  - unlike other artists, Berry had very little in his music that was viewed as a "threat"
- Johnny B. Goode (1958) -> #2 R&B / #8 Pop
