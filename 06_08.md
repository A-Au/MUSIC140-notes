Chuck Berry - cont'd
--------------------
- Johnny B. Goode (1958) -> #2 R&B / #8 Pop

    - narrative -> tells a story
  - why a lot of words?
    - did research and decided to become a rich musician
    - meant he needed to sell a lot of music to white people
    - tried to figure out which black artists white people like
      - clear articulation + lots of words + stories
  - white elements:
    - text-heavy narrative
    - clear enunciation
    - country guitar sound, but
      - cleaner and brighter
  - black elements:
    - blues chord structure
    - added 6th (boogie woogie)

    - guitar solo is structured on timbre and rhythm
  - Berry's Impact:

"The Golden Age of Rock and Roll" (1954-1959)
---------------------------------------------
- Corruption - Payola:
  - Major labels imlicitly link race with the "quality" of the music
  - But labels only care about money, so why don't rock and roll arts get signed to major labels?
    - Rock artists don't fit into "division of labour" model, they write their own music
  - Rock and Roll is attacked on the grounds that it's inferior music
    - inferior = black influenced
  - Payola Hearings (bribery)
    - Payola -> slang term in music industry for corruption, specifically bribery
  - Spin: how does rock and roll get played so much? The dick jockeys must be being bribed!
    - And of course, they were. Everyone was taking bribes under threat of violence
  - Alan Freed (disc jockey from 05/25 lesson)
    - Sued, hounded by the irs, and driven into poverty
- Rock and roll takes off:

  - May 1954: Brown vs The Board of Education
    - Segregated schools dis-allowed
    - Superintendents blocked black kids
    - Black kids had to walk past white parents screaming abuse at them
  - December 1955: Rosa Parks -> Montgomery Bus Boycott
    - A talented seamstress
    - Counter to the myth:
      - She wasn't tired and didn't sit at the front of the bus (it was illegal at the time)
      - She was told to move despite being in the black section, even though there was as seat beside her
      - Driver joins in and moves the sign of where black people are allowed to sit
      - Police come and arrest her
    - Black community joins together to boycott the bus, despite not having cars
      - Walking many miles a day
    - Bussing system losing money because many people that took the bus were black
    - After a year the laws were changed
  - Freedom riders
    - Not allowed to have a white and black person sit next to each other while crossing state lines
    - So this group did that on every state line they could
    - Lead to angry mobs and beatings
  - Lunch counter sit-ins
    - Lunch counters at department stores with signs that say "white's only"
    - Well-dressed group of young black people would come and take all the counter seats, even though they wouldn't be served
      - Always polite despite a torrent of racist abuse
    - Police could do nothing about it because they weren't breaking a law
    - Slowly the signs came down
  - As a principle: non-violent breaking of laws to draw attention to them
  - Martin Luther King Jr.
    - minister at Rosa Parks' church
- dislike of rock and roll is linked to middle-class white fears regarding the growing strength of the Civil Rights movement

The Great Extinction
--------------------
- March 1958 -> Elvis enters the army
- December 1959 -> Chuck Berry arrested under the "Mann Act"
  - "Mann Act" -> Law from 1800s designed to protect white women from slavery
    - Family friend with teenage daughter that had trouble getting motivated
      - Asked if the daughter could get a job at one of Chuck's nightclubs
      - Immediately arrested when bringing the daughter over state lines, police assumed daughter to be brought over for prostitution

    - Media got it wrong - she was 14
    - Still wasn't fully divorced
- 1975 -> Little Richard retires and becomes a minister
  - And later comes back... and even later becomes a minister again
  - End of him doing anything groundbreaking
- Buddy Holly ("The guy who made wearing glasses cool")
  - February 1959, dies in a plane crash
- In this void, major labels figure out how to make music that _sounds_ like rock and roll. Enter...

The "In-Between" years (1959 - 1963)
------------------------------------
- AKA "The Empire Strikes Back" (major labels being the empire)
- Between the end of the golden age of rock and roll and the arrival of The Beatles
- New type of Rock and Roll -> aimed at teenagers of the late 1950s/early 1960s
  - Major labels notice people like music made by people around their age
    - Find and market music made by teenagers (or that look like teenagers)
- Dance songs -> songs that tell you how to do the dance move in the lyrics
  - "The Locomotion" - Little Eva (Goffin, King) 1962
    - Notice that two people wrote the song, back to division of labour
      - But now it _sounds_ a lot like rock and roll
- Teen idols: Clean-cut, idealized boyfriend - no "bad boy" image from the golden age
- Bobby Vinton - "Blue Velvet" (1963)
  - Composed in 1950
  - Hit for Tony Bennett in 1951
- Songs are written specifically for the new teen demograpgic
  - Romantic (non-sexualized) love, and dancing
  - Most of the newer artists did not write songs, so where were they coming from?
    - Many coming from The Brill Building
      - An actual location, but as a term used more like "Tin Pan Alley"
- Don Kirshaner / Al Nevins -> Aldon Music
  - Most successful songwriters of the time
  - Extremely quick turnaround:
    - Written on Monday, recorded on Wednesday, Released by Monday
    - Who sings the songs is more based on why was in town at the time

The Rise of the Producer
------------------------
- Jack Mullens -> Magnetophone / reel-to-reel tape machine
  - Shown to Bing Crosby who had a problem -> he ran a radio show, which were all live at the time, but he was busy a lot too
    - Could be pre-recorded on records, but they had some technical issues like popping
    - Magnetophone is exactly what he's looking for
    - Becomes the first person to pre-record a national broadcast
    - Using tape instead of records allows for editing
      - Can cut out boring parts
      - Can re-cut the tape to make a flop of a joke appear to be hilarious
        - Invented the laugh-track
    - Invests a huge amount of his money into The Ampex Tape Company
- 1948, Bing gives one of the first commercially produced reel-to-reel tape recorders to Les Paul
- Les Paul (1915 - 2009)
  - Jazz, pop, country
  - Had his own TV show "At home with Les Paul and Mary Ford"
  - 1941 The "Log"
    - If he makes a guitar out of a solid material, the energy stays in the string, and sounds longer
      - Can still be loud using amplification
    - Invents the solid-body electric guitar
  - In 1952 releases the Gibson Les Paul
  - Wants to create recordings by layering performances
    - Very interested in the Magnetophone when Bing shows him it
  - Assists in the development of the "multitrack" tape recorder
- Example of multitrack: "Sitting On Top of the World" - Les Paul with Mary Ford, 1953
  - All vocals Mary Ford
  - All Instruments Les Paul with a guitar, playing the tape at different speeds
  - When did this performance take place?
    - Trick question: it didn't happen at _one_ time, it was multiple recordings played together
    - "A hugely important moment" -> "recording shifts from a process of re-production to production"
      - Re-production -> like taking a picture on film
      - Production -> like taking a digital picture and editing it in photoshop
      - Redefines the process of recording
