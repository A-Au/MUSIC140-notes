- Two other styles of music become important although neither fit the division of labour model

The Folk Revival:
-----------------
- Many of the teen fans of the golden age are now in their early 20s
- Now in university, many are looking for music that is more "serious"
  - Music is often used as a way to relate to others in University
- Folk music
  - Pre WW2
  - Very politically left -> union movement
  - Avoids a "formal" or "professional" look/sound
- Woody Guthrie
  - Written on his guitar: "This Machine Kills Faschists"
    - Who operate machines?
      - Factory workers, labourers, etc
    - Represents that views himself as a labourer/worker
- The Weavers: Pete Seeger
  - Important figure in banjo playing techniques
  - This Land is Your Land (Woody Guthrie, 1940), performed by The Weavers
    - Not the song you might have sung in elementary school
    - Written in response to "God Bless America"
      - "God Bless America" says God is on the side of America and anything America does is right
      - He doesn't think America is perfect, so wrote this song
      - Literally means that this land is everyone's
    - Great singers, but don't emphasize/show it off
    - sucessfull from late 1940s to 1953
    - "blacklisted" in 1953 because of left-wing connection
- HUAC (House Un-American Activities Committee) and McCarthyism (1947-1956)
  - Senator Joseph McCarthy
    - His job to find communists and expose them
      - "Are you or have you been a member of the communist party?" Two responses
        - No
          - They don't believe you, hold you in comtempt
          - Lose your job
          - Life left in shambles
        - Yes, but I was young and I'm not anymore
          - Have to give a list of everyone you associated with, and they all get called in
        - Either have your life ruined or ruin the lives of your friends
  - 1953, Seeger called to the committee
    - Refused to give the names of people he associated with
    - Within a month The Weavers' were out of work
- For several years no one is interested in Folk Music because of its association with the left
- Late 1950s / Early 1960s -> Baby boom reaches college
  - Interest in "serious" music
    - Find parents' Folk records
  - Younger Folk musicians appear targeted at baby boomers -> the folk revival
- The Kingston Trio / Peter Paul and Mary
  - similar to earlier music but more "produced"
    - smoother sounding, more "arranged"
    - done on purpose because baby boomers are used to it during the golden age
- The original sound of folk is carried by a new generation of singer-songwriters:
  - Robert Zimmerman
    - Born in Monnesota -> Moved to NY for more opportunities
    - Changed his name to Bob Dylan

    - Audience angry and booing
    - People felt betrayed
    - People viewed it as an integrity thing
      - Couldn't imagine someone with integrity playing rock and roll
      - Traditional folk music had to appear "authentic", and not part of the music industry
      - In a way, it was Bob Dylan telling everyone that their folk music _is_ a part of the music industry
    - Booing got so bad that the band left the stage
    - Pete Seeger had to be physically held back from attacking Bob Dylan
